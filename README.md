# Refactoring Java

The code creates an information slip about movie rentals.
Rewrite and improve the code after your own liking.

Think: you are responsible for the solution, this is a solution you will have to put your name on.


## Handing in the assignment

Reason how you have been thinking and the decisions you took. 
You can hand in the result any way you feel (git patch, pull-request or ZIP-file).
Note: the Git history must be included.


## To run the test:

```
javac src/*.java
java -cp src service.src.main.java.Main
```
## My thoughts and reflection

I could've done changes in this in for an eternity it feels like. 
If I myself would've made this project from scratch I would probably have put the movies in a database, and written the code accordingly.

I did just a few test but of course I can see that there are many more relevant tests to be made.

In the beginning I wanted the method to at a rental to be chainable, but I realised after much struggle that it would take too much time to figure out how to make it work. But it would've been cool.
